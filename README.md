# Guilan Headball

**Guilan Headball** is a simple and fun headball-style game developed by students of **University of Guilan**.  
The game features elements inspired by the university itself. Characters are loosely based on respected professors from the Computer Engineering Department of Guilan University â€” although their names have been changed to avoid any misunderstanding or offense.
